- The Interpreter pattern is used anytime we need to evaluate any kind of language grammar or expressions. 
- A good example of this pattern would be Google Translate, which interprets the input, and shows us the output in another language.
- Another example would be the Java compiler. The compiler interprets Java code and translates it into bytecode that the JVM uses to perform operations on the device it runs on.
