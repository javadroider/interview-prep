- Adapter design pattern is one of the structural design pattern and its used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together. The object that joins these unrelated interface is called an Adapter.

- The Adapter pattern, as the name implies, adapts one interface to another. It acts as a bridge between two unrelated, and sometimes even completely incompatible interfaces, similar to how a scanner acts as a bridge between a paper and a computer. A computer can't store a paper as a PDF document, but a scanner, which combines the functionalities of both, can scan it and allow the computer to store it.
